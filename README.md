* ~~Create scripts for units that inherit behavior and are extensible~~
* ~~Create simple game management script allowing the spawning of different units with keys and the automated spawning of enemies~~
* ~~Get combat system working so that units can move/fight and bases can be destroyed~~
* ~~Get simple UI allowing mouse clicks to spawn units~~
* ~~Touch base and make sure everyone understands project organization at this point~~


### From here, two different branches can be worked on:

#### Branch 1 - Gameplay

* ~~Preliminary tower assets~~
* Design and allow for the creation of towers (1.5 hr)
* Plan how the economy will work - this means how it will balance against enemy economy (1 hr)
* Write up how the economy is supposed to work, how the units are supposed to work, present to team (6 hr)
* Write enemy AI (1 hr)
* Start to balance gameplay with low-res sprites *THIS WILL TAKE THE MOST TIME* (69 hr)

#### Branch 2 - Aesthetics

* Add artwork for units (outsourced)
* Add animations for units: walking, attacking, dying (4.5 hr)
* Add sounds for units being hit, shooting, etc (1.5 hr)
* Add artwork for bases (0.5 hr)
* Add artwork for towers (0.5 hr)
* Add game over scene, menu scene, game options (difficulty? sound options) (1 hr)
* Finish UI using unit artwork and stylized UI

### Merge branches

* Integrate branches, test that everything works
