* Create scripts for units that inherit behavior and are extensible
* Create simple game management script allowing the spawning of different units with keys and the automated spawning of enemies
* Get combat system working so that units can move/fight and bases can be destroyed
* Get simple UI allowing mouse clicks to spawn units
* Touch base and make sure everyone understands project organization at this point


### From here, two different branches can be worked on:

#### Branch 1 - Gameplay

* Preliminary tower assets
* Design and allow for the creation of towers
* Plan how the economy will work - this means how it will balance against enemy economy
* Write up how the economy is supposed to work, how the units are supposed to work, present to team
* Start to balance gameplay with low-res sprites *THIS WILL TAKE THE MOST TIME*

#### Branch 2 - Aesthetics

* Add artwork for units
* Add animations for units: walking, attacking, dying
* Add sounds for units being hit, shooting, etc
* Add artwork for bases
* Add artwork for towers
* Add game over scene, menu scene, game options (difficulty? sound options)
* Finish UI using unit artwork

### Merge branches

* Integrate branches, test that everything works
* Keep balancing gameplay
* More balancing
